# "Quantifying DOM Scaling Relationships and Trends in Watersheds"

Welcome to the Species Richness Scaling Law repository! This research project explores the relationship between species richness (i.e., compound metrics) and watershed characteristics using various environmental datasets and data-driven methods. The repository includes data and associated links, notes in curating the data (e.g., graphics, slides), and data analysis scripts in understanding species-watershed relationships.
