# "Quantifying DOM Scaling Relationships and Trends in Watersheds"

Welcome to the Species Richness Scaling Law repository! This research project explores the relationship between species richness (i.e., compound metrics) and watershed characteristics using various environmental datasets and data-driven methods. The repository includes data and associated links, notes in curating the data (e.g., graphics, slides), and data analysis scripts in understanding species-watershed relationships.

## Research overview

Our aim is to analyze how species richness scales with the habitat features. This relationship is crucial for biodiversity conservation, ecological studies, and environmental management. By leveraging multiple environmental datasets and advanced statistical methods, the project provides insights into the species-area relationship across different regions and ecosystems.
